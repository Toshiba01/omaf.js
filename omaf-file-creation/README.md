# OMAF File Creation tools

Provides guidelines for creation of test vectors for HEVC-based viewport-dependent OMAF video profile with MCTS.

In the following it is explained how to create OMAF compliant files from raw (yuv) ERP source video files.

Destination format:

- Projection: CMP
- Number of tiles: 24 (24 high and 24 low res tiles)
  - High resolution tile size: 768x768
  - Low resolution tile size: 384x384
- Number of 'viewport' streams (hvc2 tracks) = 24
  - Each 'viewport' stream consists of: 12 high resolution tiles and 12 low resolution tiles with following packing:

## Required tools

Following tools are required for this script to work:

- **Python 2.7** with support for following modules (those modules are commonly used and you probably don't need to do anything.)
    1. [argparse](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/argparse.html)
    2. [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/subprocess.html)
    3. [re](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/re.html)
    4. [time](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/time.html)
    5. [os](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/os.html)
    6. [sys](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/sys.html)
- **ffmpeg**: Everyone should know what ffmpeg is. Downlolad static build for your OS from [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- **TAppEncoder**: HM reference encoder. Download source code from [here](https://hevc.hhi.fraunhofer.de/svn/svn_HEVCSoftware/tags/HM-16.19).
- **TApp360Convert**: Projection format conversion tool for 360 video. Download source code from [here](https://jvet.hhi.fraunhofer.de/svn/svn_360Lib/tags/360Lib-5.0). This tool depends on HM software, therefore follow the descriptions in [readme.txt](https://jvet.hhi.fraunhofer.de/svn/svn_360Lib/tags/360Lib-5.0/360Lib-5.0_README.txt) to compile TApp360ConvertStatic together with TAppEncoderStatic.
- **hevc2omaf**: Command line tool for creation of OMAF content.

Compiled static binaries for **TAppEncoder**, **TApp360Convert**, and **hevc2omaf** should be located in ./bin/[linux|osx|win]

Please consider building these tools if they are missing in ./bin/[YourOS]

Also make sure that **ffmpeg** is installed on your system and is set in your `$PATH`

## Description of the script

This script takes as input an ERP projected YUV file and creates the OMAF test vectors in the following 5 steps:

### Step 1: convert ERP yuv to high res CMP yuv

        WARNING: This file is a raw video file with 6k resolution, it will consume a lot of storage.

### Step 2: downlscale highres CMP yuv to additional lowres CMP yuv

### Step 3: split both high and low res files into 24 tiles (each). This creates all required yuv tiles

### Step 4: encode each tile as MCTS for provided QPs

        WARNING: if you use HM this process might consume a lot of time since HM reference software is not optimized for speed. Using HM you can also only encode a single QP. Consider using another encoder if you want to save some time or use multiple QPs.

### Step 5: package encoded HEVC bitstreams to OMAF files

all the output is written to the output directory specified using `-o` command line argument. Use --help for more information on other arguments.

## Example usage

Use kvazaar encoder and process 1017 frames of raw_video.yuv with two QPs 32 and 25 and use max 12 threads:

    ./create_omaf_files.py -s 1-5 -i raw_video.yuv -f 1017 -fr 30 -q 32 25 -t 12 --codec 1 -o kvazaarEncoding

Use HM encoder and only encode and package 270 frames of yuv files from 'folder/with/yuvs' directory and name the sequenze 'Garage'

    ./create_omaf_files.py -s 4-5 -i folder/with/yuvs -f 270 -fr 30 -q 32 -t 8 --codec 0 -c conf/encoder_randomaccess_main_RAP9.cfg -p Garage -o HMencodings

Use HM encoder and only encode and package 270 frames of yuv files from 'folder/with/yuvs' directory and name the sequence 'Garage' with 3GPP Advance Video Media profile :

        ./create_omaf_files.py -s 4-5 -i folder/with/yuvs -f 270 -fr 30 -q 32 -t 8 --mode avm --codec 0 -c conf/encoder_randomaccess_main_RAP9.cfg -p Garage -o HMencodings
